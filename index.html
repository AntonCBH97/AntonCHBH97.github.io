      <h1> The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess - An Overview</h1>
      
      <p>
        Released as the thirteenth entry in Nintendo's long running 'The Legend of Zelda' series,
        <em>Twilight Princess</em> launched for both the <strong>Nintendo GameCube</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Wii</strong> in November 2006.

      <p>
        Initially announced for the GameCube, the game would end up releasing first on Wii in North American regions.
        While the core gameplay is largely identical between both home console releases, several alterations needed to be made to the Wii version
        in order to incorporate the use of <strong>motion controls</strong> and to better accomodate right-handed players. 
        <em>Twilight Princess</em> received critical acclaim from longtime fans and gaming media outlets alike upon its initial release, 
        and was the best selling entry of the series until being surpassed by <em><a href = "https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.586dbfbd9819436bbf304a7e3f67d42a?rik=uLMHuuEnFJpCtg&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em> in 2018. 
        Its most recent re-release is the 2016 high-definition remaster, <em><a href = "https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Wii-U-games/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Twilight-Princess-HD-1082222.html">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD</a></em>, available
        on the <strong>Nintendo Wii U</strong> console.

      <h3> Accolades / Legacy </h3>

      <p> 
        Shortly after its release on GameCube and Wii, <em>Twilight Princess</em> received substantial favorable reviews from video game
        news sites such as <em>IGN</em>, <em>Electronic Gaming Monthly</em>, <em>Game Informer</em>, and <em>GamesRadar</em>. As per the review aggregate site
        <em>Metacritic</em>, the GameCube version earned a score of 96/100 and 95/100 for the Wii version. <em>Twilight Princess</em> would go on to 
        be the highest-rated video game release of 2006. Many of the elements present in <em>Twilight Princess</em> would pave the way for a number
        of future titles, such as: environmental storytelling, horseback combat, and a more expanded overworld where areas are
        naturally connected with one another.
        In total, the game sold 8.85 million copies worldwide across both platforms by September 2015.

      <h3> Personal Thoughts - Website Author </h3>

      <p>
        <em> The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess </em> stands as not only my favorite entry of the Zelda franchise, but it is also my favorite video game of all time.
        I received both a Nintendo Wii console and a copy of the game for Christmas 2006 when I was a young boy. It is a memory that I can recall vividly
        even as an adult. Vastly different from any video game that I had played up to that point in my life, it was the first title to make me realize just
        how impactful video games are as an entertainment medium. Even if the visuals haven't aged gracefully in a world where ultra high-definition
        resolutions are the norm, the core gameplay itself is one that I will always find myself coming back to.
